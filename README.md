# aol-poetry-slam
Refrigerator Poetry Slam is a nostalgic, Y2K-inspired poetry generator wrapped in a playful AOL-era interface. Users can generate glitchy, emotional, and apocalyptic poems in a randomized 3–2–3 format using a curated word bank drawn from tech, disaster, and late-90s internet culture.
